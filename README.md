# kmutahar homebrew-tap

## Purpose

The main purpose of this Brew tap is to add any and call MacOS applications that I use that are not available in the main [Homebrew/homebrew-cask tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask)

### Cask Updates

Many of the Casks are not updated until the time I will be re-downloading said Cask, however please feel free to make a pull request for updates or anything.


## How do I install these casks?
`brew cask install kmutahar/tap/<cask>`

Or `brew tap kmutahar/tap` and then `brew cask install <cask>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmutahar/homebrew-tap/master/Casks/<cask>.rb
```
